This weeks project was to build a multi-page React app using themoviedb.org's open movie API. To fetch a list of movies, display them on a page and link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie. 
To solve this I used React router, placeholders in url:s to pick dynamic parts from url:s and combining useState with useEffect.

More ideas:
Fetch more information from the API to make links from the movie page to for exampel the official movie homepage, related movies etc.
