This project was to build a multi-page React app using themoviedb.org's open movie API, to fetch a list of movies, display them on a page and link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie. 
To solve this I used React router, placeholders in url:s to pick dynamic parts from url:s and combining useState with useEffect.
If I had more time I would have fetched more information from the API to use this data to make links from the movie page to another page.
